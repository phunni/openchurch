Donate to the OpenChurch project.


Please feel free to donate to the OpenChurch project.  You can either use the button below to make a one off donation, or you could sponsor me so that I can develop this project full-time.

I feel that this project has real potential to be a powerful tool for local churches - not just in aiding administration, but also in developing community, doing outreach and providing resources. If you would like to provide sponsorship then please get in touch by emailing me at phunnilemur at gmail dot com.
