**News**

**18/11/2011** Slowly working through embedding Pluto 2 into openchurch as the portlet container - however, this is slow going due to complete lack of documentation

**29/08/2011** No work has been done on this project for a while due to ill health.  I am now looking at implementing Portlets again, although I may abandon this in favour of a more simple proprietary solution.

**28/05/2010** Now working on implementing Portlet support via Apache Pluto

**06/03/2010** It is now possible to log in as the admin user

**I now have a new computer and work on OpenChurch continues, albeit slowly.**

A free, open source and extensible framework for building church websites.

The project is currently in the early stages, but has the potential to be an extremely useful tool in facilitating the building of local churches.

The project advances - but much more slowly than I would like.  If you would like to sponsor me to develop this project full time; or would simply like to make a donation then please find details on the [Donations](http://code.google.com/p/openchurch/wiki/Donate) wiki page.
