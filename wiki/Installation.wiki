Installing Open Church.

= Introduction =
It should be noted that, at this stage, OpenChurch is still in the very early stages.  There is a J2EE application that you can build and deploy, but it doesn't do very much yet.  There are also JUnit tests which can be run for the curious; but they will give you little information beyond an idea of the early data structure.

== Requirements ==

In order to successfully install OpenChurch, you will require the following:
    * Java 1.5 or above
    * Maven
    * A J2EE server such as glassfish or JBoss
    * A SQL compliant database such as Oracle, MySQL or MS SQL Server



== Installation ==

    # Download the source code from subversion. Click on the 'Source' tab above to find details.
    Locate the pom.xml in openchurch/openchurch-core/openchurch-core-data and uncomment the appropriate JDBC driver in the dependencies
    # In the root directory of the project, you will find a directory called SQL.  Run the SQL that you find there on your database. *Please Note:* This script has only currently been tested on MS SQL Server & MySQL. It cannot be guaranteed to work on any other database server.  Other servers will be fully supported in the near future.
    # Create a JNDI Datasource called 'jdbc/openchurch' pointing to the databse that was created in the last step.
    # Edit the openchurch-core/openchurch-core-data/src/test/resources/db.properties file to contain the relvant values for connecting to your database and save it as db.properties .  This is for the unit tests.  
    # In the root directory of the project, run {{{ mvn clean install package }}}
    # If all has gone well you should now have an ear file in the target directory.
