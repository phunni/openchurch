Donate to the OpenChurch project.


Please feel free to donate to the OpenChurch project.  You can either use the button below to make a one off donation, or you could sponsor me so that I can develop this project full-time.

I feel that this project has real potential to be a powerful tool for local churches - not just in aiding administration, but also in developing community, doing outreach and providing resources.
